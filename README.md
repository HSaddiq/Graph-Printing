A short example showing how the numpy2stl library can be used to create 3D representations of parametric based surfaces. The example shows the use of the library with the monkey saddle function:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=z&space;=&space;x^3-3xy^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z&space;=&space;x^3-3xy^2" title="z = x^3-3xy^2" /></a>

Which has a stationary point at (0,0,0) which cannot be classified using conventional methods.
